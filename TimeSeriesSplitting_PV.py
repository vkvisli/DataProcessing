"""

This module reads time-series data for photovoltaic (PV) solar panels associated with the CoSSMic project
and splits this data into individual 24 hour 'runs'. These runs are also split by season, and are saved as csv files.
Finally, it plots visual charts for both time-series data and the individual runs.
