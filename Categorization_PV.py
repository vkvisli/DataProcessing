"""

This module performs categorization of PV runs/profiles into weather types
(sunny, partially cloudy, cloudy, and rainy), based on their total energy generation.
The categorization is done on the already season-separated runs created with "TimeSeriesSplitting_PV".
JSON files for each category is saved and visual charts showing the weather categories are displayed.
